## Analysis of agricultural activities: geographical patterns and temporal trends
Objectives: 
(1) Explore how agriculture practices have changed over time; 
(2) Identify regions where changes were either faster or slower.

Data available: The available information are numbers per civil parishes. Proportions should be used to allow comparing among regions and over time.
Types of analysis: ordination techniques with temporal dimension (for example defining temporal pathways within the multivariate space); time series analysis.
Visualizations: Line plots describing temporal trends; multivariate analysis outputs (e.g. PCA biplots); possibly Sankey/alluvial diagrams may also be appropriate to describe changes over time.
